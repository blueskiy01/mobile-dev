# Bizz-Card Project Readme

## Introduction

Welcome to BizzCard! This project is designed as part of my learning process on the basics of Flutter by building a simple application that displays personal information on a static card.

## What is Flutter?

Flutter is Googleâ€™s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

## Requirements

It's recommended to use editors that have Dart and Flutter plugins such as Android Studio or VS Code.

- Flutter SDK
- Dart SDK
- Android Studio or VS Code
- Emulator or Physical Device

## Overview

BizzCard is a simple application that displays a static card with personal information. The project is divided into three parts to help one learn about Flutter widgets, the basic structure of a Flutter app, and how to run Flutter on physical devices or emulators.

### Features

The following information are displayed on the BizzCard:

- First Name
- Last Name
- Age
- Phone number
- Email
- Photo/Image

Also included are:

- An AppBar with the backgroundColor set to blueAccent and title "BizzCard"
- A profile picture with a circular shape
- First Name and Last Name displayed in bold with font size 30
- Age, email, and phone number displayed with font size 20

Flutter widgets such as AppBar, Column, Stack, Padding, and DecorationImage are explored, to implement the required features.
